# Insecure Express.js Route Handling: Missing Input Validation and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common vulnerability in Express.js applications: insecure route handling due to missing input validation and error handling. The vulnerable code is in `bug.js`, while the secure solution is in `bugSolution.js`.

**Vulnerability:**

The provided code lacks input validation for user IDs, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.  Additionally, error handling is insufficient, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to unexpected application behavior.

**Solution:**

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a secure version of the code. It incorporates:

1. **Input Validation:** User IDs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Robust Error Handling:** Errors are handled gracefully, providing appropriate responses to the client and preventing information leakage.
3. **Proper Status Codes:** Appropriate HTTP status codes are used to signal success or failure.

This example highlights the critical need for secure coding practices in web applications to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
